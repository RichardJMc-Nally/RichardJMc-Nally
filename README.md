- I once debugged an error that turned out to be my cat walking on the keyboard.
- I’m serious about clean code — and just as serious about keeping my workspace spotless 🧼   
- I love a good challenge, especially ones that make me think: *“There has to be a better way to do this”* 💭  
- I believe humor is just as important in code reviews as it is in life 😂
